# Tidbyt Apps

Use [pixlet](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet) to build apps for [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) using [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark).


## Getting started

* Install the [VSCode `vscode-starlark` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phgn.vscode-starlark).
* Install the [iOS app](https://tidbyt.com/app).

The `pixlet` executable is included in the project, so you can develop with:

```bash
$ bin/pixlet serve --watch src/quigital.star
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080/
